STEP 1 — Build Clean Backend Architecture

Not routes only.

Learn:

project folder structure

routers separation

services layer

repository pattern

config management

environment handling

👉 Goal: maintainable backend


STEP 2 — Database Production Skills

You already know SQL → now learn:

migrations (Alembic)

indexing strategy

query optimization

connection pooling

transactions

soft deletes

audit logging

👉 Goal: reliable data layer



STEP 3 — Async & Performance (VERY IMPORTANT)

This is where many FastAPI devs fail.

Learn:

async vs sync DB calls

background tasks

job queues

streaming responses

caching with Redis

rate limiting

👉 Goal: fast backend


STEP 4 — Auth & Security (Must for production)

Learn:

JWT auth properly

refresh tokens

role-based access

password hashing

API key protection

request validation

preventing prompt injection (for AI)

👉 Goal: safe backend
